# Madina Enterprises – Cotton Brokerage App

This is a cross-platform cotton brokerage management system developed in **.NET MAUI** for **Madina Enterprises**. The app provides modules to manage core entities such as **Ginners, Mills, Contracts, Deliveries, Payments**, and **Ginner Ledger**, all powered by a local **SQLite database**.

- **Ginner Ledger** – Maintain deal-level payment records with date and mill due tracking.
- **Navigation Panel** – A persistent sidebar for quick page access.

## ⚙ Technologies Used

- **.NET MAUI (Multi-platform App UI)**
- **C# with XAML**
- **SQLite for local data**
- **MVVM-like structure (code-behind with logical separation)**

## 🧩 How to Run

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MadinaEnterprises.git
cd MadinaEnterprises
```

2. **Build in Visual Studio 2022 or later**
   - Target: **.NET 7.0 or higher**
   - Platforms: **Windows / Android / iOS / macOS**

3. **Run the app**
   - The app launches with the `LoginPage`.
   - After login, access all modules via the left-side navigation.

---

## 📁 Data Storage

SQLite DB is created at runtime inside:

```
Environment.GetFolderPath(Environment.SpecialFolder.LocalApplicationData)
```

The database file is named:

```
madina.db3
```

---

## 📌 Notes

- The app uses hardcoded navigation (`NavigationPage.PushAsync(...)`).
- All data operations are handled asynchronously via `DatabaseService.cs`.
- No cloud sync yet – ideal for offline-first businesses.

---


## 📤 Export Functionality

- **Word export**: `Contracts -> Export to DOCX` generates a clean contract document for the selected contract.
- **Excel export**: `Contracts -> Export to Excel` generates:
  - one **master workbook** (Contracts, Deliveries, Payments)
  - one **per-ginner workbook** (Summary, Contracts, Deliveries, Payments) for each ginner with contracts
- Export files are grouped into a timestamped folder inside app data, and the app offers to open the exported file immediately after generation.

## 🔐 Authentication

This project now uses a **simple hardcoded login** flow (no signup and no forgot-password screen).

- Username: `Anees`
- Password: `4081`

You can change these constants in `Modules/Views/LoginPage.xaml.cs` (`HardcodedUsername` and `HardcodedPassword`).
