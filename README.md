This is a cross-platform cotton brokerage management system developed in **.NET MAUI** for **Madina Enterprises**. The app provides modules to manage core entities such as **Ginners, Mills, Contracts, Deliveries, Payments**, and **Ginner Ledger**, all powered by a local **SQLite database**.

## 🧩 How to Run

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MadinaEnterprises.git
cd MadinaEnterprises
```

2. **Build in Visual Studio 2022 or later**
   - Target: **.NET 7.0 or higher**
   - Platforms: **Windows / Android / iOS / macOS**

3. **Run the app**
   - The app launches with the `LoginPage`.
   - After login, access all modules via the left-side navigation.

---

## 📁 Data Storage

SQLite DB is created at runtime inside:

```
Environment.GetFolderPath(Environment.SpecialFolder.LocalApplicationData)
```

The database file is named:

```
madina.db3
```

---

## 📌 Notes

- The app uses hardcoded navigation (`NavigationPage.PushAsync(...)`).
- All data operations are handled asynchronously via `DatabaseService.cs`.
- No cloud sync yet – ideal for offline-first businesses.

---

## 🔐 Authentication

Currently uses a placeholder `LoginPage`. You can integrate secure authentication (e.g., Firebase, Microsoft Identity) as needed.
